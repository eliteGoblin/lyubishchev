# Thoughts about labels, tags

*  Focus on what I want to see in report, rather than label, categorize every time interval
*  Tags should be flexible, not fixed or predefined, so NOT suitable to fix it in Clockify, should be input
*  Tags should be flexible, not fixed or predefined, so NOT suitable to fix it in Clockify, should be input

# human_connection

Time I feel connected with people and enjoy being with them

My feeling matters, same type of activity means quite different to different people. Tool's idea is make a system for myself.

When I joined to a lunch that not spoke much, but I was there, this time is labeled as routine, not human connection
